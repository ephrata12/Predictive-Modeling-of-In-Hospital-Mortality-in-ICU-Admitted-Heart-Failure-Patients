# Predictive Modeling of In-Hospital Mortality in ICU-Admitted Heart Failure Patients

## Project Overview
This project applies predictive modeling techniques to identify significant clinical and demographic predictors of in-hospital mortality among ICU-admitted heart failure patients. 

## Dataset
- **Source**: MIMIC-III Database (2001â€“2012)
- **Scope**: 1,177 observations with 69 variables covering demographics, vital signs, comorbidities, and lab results
- **Missing Data**: 97% observed, 3% missing

## Research Questions
1. Which clinical and demographic variables are the most significant predictors of in-hospital mortality?
2. How can we balance model interpretability with predictive accuracy?
3. How do varying patient profiles associate with mortality risk?

## Limitations
- Single-center dataset
- Missing data may impact predictive accuracy
